This is where the policies are generated in protobuf
format. You will need to install protobuf for python3
to use these.  The easiest way is to create a virtual
environment for python3 (optional) and then pip
install protobuf.

Use policyexample.py to generate an example
json/protobuf file for the proto file policy.proto.

Use json2pb.py to generate a protobuf image file
from a source json file (similar to the one generated
by policyexample.py).
